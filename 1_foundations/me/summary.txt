My name is Benjamin Arbab. I'm a network engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Iran, mashhad, but I moved to CA in 2011.
I love all foods, particularly Mexican food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of Vietnamese food. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I love sports, particularly Tennis and I have been active for a quite long time.
